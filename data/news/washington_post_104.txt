A Maryland man has been charged with sexually grabbing at least 10 women as he rode past them on a bicycle over the past 18 months in downtown Washington, near Dupont Circle and in the city's West End, according to police and court documents.

Daniel Adam Grob, 46, of Riverdale in Prince George's County, was arrested Saturday in Maryland. Documents filed in D.C. Superior Court show he was charged with 11 counts of misdemeanor sexual abuse, all in Northwest Washington.

Police said the attacks started in June 2022 and went into this past November. Efforts to reach Grob's attorney were not successful Wednesday.

According to a police arrest affidavit, the incidents occurred at various hours of the day and night. In most cases, police said, Grob rode past female bicyclists or pedestrians and grabbed or touched their breasts or buttocks. In one case, police said, a woman's shirt was pulled down.

The areas of the attacks, according to police, included K, L and 17th streets, not far from the White House; New Hampshire Avenue near Dupont Circle; and 19th and 24th streets in the West End.

The affidavit says investigators got their first break after an attack in August on New Hampshire Avenue. The victim gave police a detailed description of the man's clothing and said he had been using a ride-share bicycle.

With the time and a surveillance photo, police said, they obtained a search warrant to determine who in that area at that hour had an internet location activated.

Police said in the affidavit that Grob's name surfaced, leading them to his Instagram account and to a photo they said matched the man in the surveillance picture.

The affidavit says that among other evidence in the case, location information matched Grob to the places and times of three other attacks.
