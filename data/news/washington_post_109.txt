2 charged in October double fatal shooting

Two D.C. men have been arrested and charged in a double fatal shooting during an attempted robbery in Prince George's County in October, Prince George's County police said.

Charles Washington Jr., 31, and Antonio Jackson, 32, are charged in the killings of Derrick Graham, 41, of Oxon Hill and DeAngelo Moore, 32, of D.C., police said. Washington is charged with first- and second-degree murder and related counts, and Jackson is charged with second-degree murder, according to police.

Washington and Jackson are in custody in D.C., police said.

According to an initial investigation, Washington, Jackson and Moore were attempting to rob Graham at gunpoint, police said. At the time of the shooting, during the attempted robbery, Moore and Graham were shot. Police said Graham was unarmed. Graham did not know Washington, Jackson or Moore, police said.

Officers responded just before midnight Oct. 3 in the 800 block of Irvington Street and found Graham and Moore with gunshot wounds, police said. Graham was pronounced dead at a hospital shortly after. Moore died two days later, police said.

It was not immediately clear whether Jackson or Washington has an attorney.
