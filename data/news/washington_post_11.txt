Car crashes into hospital in Pr. George's

A car crashed into a hospital in Prince George's County on Sunday, disrupting its intensive care unit and forcing some ICU patients to be transferred elsewhere, authorities said.

No injuries were reported in the crash at the Adventist HealthCare Fort Washington Medical Center, police and a hospital spokeswoman said.

However, the car caused significant damage to the building, said Sara Newman, a spokeswoman for the medical center. "It didn't go through" the wall of the building, "but it left a hole," she said.

The car struck the building where the ICU is located as well as a nearby generator, Newman said. Some patients were moved elsewhere in the hospital, and some were transferred to other hospitals.

It was unclear when normal ICU operations could resume, she said.

The crash occurred around 10:40 a.m., said Officer Emily Austin, a spokeswoman for the Prince George's County police.

The driver allegedly lost control of the vehicle and was given a citation, she said.
