Woman arrested, charged in slaying

D.C. police have arrested a 24-year-old woman and charged her with first-degree murder in a November killing.

In an affidavit filed Wednesday in D.C. Superior Court, police said Yazmin Owens fatally shot 26-year-old Nakysia Rachael Lemon-Williams on Nov. 14, just after 7:30 a.m. in the 1900 block of Minnesota Avenue SE.

The lawyer listed for Owens in court records did not immediately respond to request for comment.

Police said neither Owens nor Lemon-Williams had fixed addresses. Efforts to reach their relatives were not immediately successful.

In the affidavit, police said Owens and Lemon-Williams were together inside an apartment building and got in an argument shortly before the shooting.

Office said security video shows Owens standing at the door to the building and firing a single shot at Lemon-Williams and another person as they walked away.

In an interview with investigators, Owens "denied having any interaction, discussion, or argument" with Lemon-Williams or the other person walking away, police said.
