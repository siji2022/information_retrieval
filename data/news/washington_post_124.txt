CORRECTION: In the Dec. 27 Metro section, a Local Digest item about a fatal shooting outside the Lâ€™Enfant Plaza Metro station incorrectly said that a second entrance, at Ninth and Seventh streets SW, remained open. Two separate entrances, one on Ninth Street SW and one on D Street SW, remained open.

THE DISTRICT

Man fatally shot in SW, outside L'Enfant Plaza

A man was found fatally shot early Tuesday outside the L'Enfant Plaza Metro station, just south of the National Mall in Southwest Washington, according to D.C. police.

Police said they were called about 4:30 a.m. to the 600 block of Maryland Avenue SW for a report of a shooting. A department spokeswoman said the victim was taken to a hospital, where he died.

The man's identity was not immediately made public.

Metro said on X that the station entrance at Seventh Street and Maryland Avenue SW was briefly closed during the police investigation. A second entrance, at Ninth and Seventh streets SW, remained open. The station serves the Orange, Silver, Blue, Yellow and Green lines.

The area is near several museums and federal buildings.
