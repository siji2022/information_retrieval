3 inmates wounded in jail stabbing, police say

Three inmates were transported to the hospital Sunday after a "stabbing incident" at the D.C. jail, authorities said.

Their injuries were considered non-life-threatening, Thomas Faust, director of the D.C. Department of Corrections, said in a statement. All three were adult men suffering from "apparent stab wounds" and were "conscious and breathing," said D.C. police spokeswoman Elizabeth Grannis.

The incident Sunday morning was an inmate-on-inmate assault and involved "multiple residents," Faust said. Injured people were treated on-site, with three inmates requiring transport to hospitals from the jail, which is located in the 1900 block of D Street SE.

The incident is being investigated by D.C. police and the Department of Corrections Office of Investigative Affairs.

Setareh Yelle, a spokeswoman for the D.C. Department of Corrections, said no other details about the case were immediately available.
