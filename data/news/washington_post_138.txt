A mental health therapist in the District has been charged with stealing more than $263,000 from the city's Medicaid program through fraudulent claims, the U.S. attorney's office said.

Bridgette White-Chase, 61, was indicted by a grand jury Wednesday for 20 alleged crimes related to Medicaid claims, including felony fraud and first-degree theft, according to documents filed in D.C. Superior Court. The documents say White-Chase operated Chase Counseling and Consulting Services and was licensed by D.C. Health to provide professional counseling services.

In a brief interview Thursday, White-Chase said the charges against her are "not true" and are based on false accusations made by disgruntled former employees.

"In my 33 years of practicing, I have never been in any trouble in my life," she said. "This started out as an allegation and spiraled into me having to defend the truth. I am devastated."

Prosecutors say that from September 2020 through January 2023, White-Chase submitted more than $263,000 in Medicaid claims for psychiatric services she did not provide and overcharges for services she did render. She pleaded not guilty at her Superior Court arraignment Wednesday and was released to await a trial.

White-Chase's profile on the Psychology Today website reads, "I am a licensed professional counselor for over 20 years and a licensed family and marriage counselor for over 6 years. ... I love individual, family, couples and marriage counseling. I have a strong background in Christian counseling, working with returning citizens (prison system), military personnel, and co-occurring disorders."

In the interview, she said, "I am looking forward to clearing up any discrepancies."
