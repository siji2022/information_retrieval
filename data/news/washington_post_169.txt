A fatal shooting occurred Friday night aboard a Metro bus in Montgomery County, the Metro transit police said. A Metro spokesman described the victim as male, but no age was available.

The homicide comes after the system made safety upgrades following a killing on Feb. 1 at the Potomac Avenue Station in D.C.

The victim in Friday night's killing reportedly was shot at about 7:45 p.m. after an altercation aboard a bus on the Z6 route, the transit police said, describing the information as preliminary.

The shooting was reported at Lockwood Drive and New Hampshire Avenue.

The assailant reportedly fled the scene, police said.
