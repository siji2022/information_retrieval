Police identify victims of double shooting

D.C. police on Saturday identified the two men who died in a double shooting on Friday morning in the Washington Highlands neighborhood of Southeast Washington.

Charles Luster Jr., 56, and Tyjon Clayton, 20, were both shot just before 11:45 a.m. in the 4200 block of Sixth Street SE, at Chesapeake Street near Hendley Elementary School, D.C. police said.

One of the men died at the scene and the other was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital after being taken there for treatment, according to a police statement Saturday. Both men lived in Southeast Washington, police said.

No arrests were made as of Saturday afternoon, and police said they were looking for a red, four-door Jeep with four occupants.

They are offering a reward of up to $25,000 for information leading to an arrest and conviction. Acting D.C. police chief Pamela A. Smith said two people jumped out of the back of the vehicle and shot the two individuals.
