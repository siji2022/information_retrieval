D.C. police on Wednesday said a man reported missing in August was fatally stabbed in a domestic dispute, and they have charged two people with murder in the case.

Lewis Jones, of Southeast Washington, is accused of killing Anthony Jordan, 42, on Aug. 4 in a bedroom of a residence in the 2500 block of Pomeroy Road SE. Jordan was reported missing Aug. 8, police said.

In an affidavit filed in court, police said Jones admitted to killing Jordan and disposing of his body in a dumpster. According to the affidavit, Jones told police that he stabbed Jordan because he thought Jordan was hurting a sibling of Jones's girlfriend. Jones told police he "blacked out after the initial stabbing," the affidavit says.

Jones made his initial appearance in D.C. Superior Court on Wednesday and was ordered held without bond. The lawyer who represented him at the initial hearing did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Police have not found Jordan's body, according to court documents.

Police said in the affidavit that Jones has a history of schizophrenia and that paperwork from one of his recent hospital visits described him as "delusional and floridly psychotic." Police also said fire officials found him wandering on a highway Aug. 6, two days after the alleged stabbing, "unable to answer any questions."

Police also said there had been a history of violence between the family of the woman whom Jones was dating and Jordan.

Police said Nichelle Thomas, 35, also of Southeast Washington, was arrested Friday in the case and charged with first-degree murder while armed and accessory after the fact to second-degree murder.
