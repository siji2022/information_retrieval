THE DISTRICT

NW resident arrested

in killing of Ky. teacher

D.C. police said they have arrested a man in connection with the killing of a Kentucky teacher and wrestling coach who was shot on the campus of Catholic University while visiting the District, authorities said Tuesday.

Jaime Macedo, 22, of Northwest Washington, was arrested after a person spotted him at Judiciary Square, near police headquarters, according to a police spokesman. Police had earlier posted pictures of a possible suspect based on images from surveillance video.

The spokesman said Macedo was charged with first-degree murder while armed in the shooting of 25-year-old Maxwell Emerson, who lived in Crestwood, Ky. Emerson's family has said he came to the District to participate in a professional development seminar for educators, and they think he was killed during a random robbery.

Few details were immediately known about Macedo or the circumstances of the shooting. Macedo could make an initial appearance in D.C. Superior Court on Wednesday, when an arrest warrant and affidavit providing additional information is expected to be unsealed.

It could not be determined Tuesday whether Macedo has an attorney in the homicide case.
