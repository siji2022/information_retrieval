THE DISTRICT

Girl, 9, wounded in shooting in SE

A 9-year-old girl was shot and wounded Sunday afternoon in Southeast Washington, D.C. police said.

The girl was hit in the back and taken to a hospital in stable condition, police said.

She was struck about 4 p.m. in the 1500 block of Shippen Lane SE and then driven to the 2700 block of Douglass Place SE, police said.

Investigators did not think she was the intended target of the gunfire.

She had been in the back seat of a car, which was occupied by two adults, a police official said. The others had not recognized that she had been hit until reaching Douglass Place, the official said.

Police did not say who the target of the gunfire had been or why it occurred.

They said they were looking for someone in a car who was wearing a ski mask.

Last year in the District, 105 children and teenagers were shot, nearly twice as many as the year before.
