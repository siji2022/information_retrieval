Gunfire kills off-duty

Park Police officer

An off-duty U.S. Park Police officer pointed a gun he didn't think was loaded at a fellow officer and pulled the trigger Sunday morning, fatally shooting him, Fairfax County police said.

By the time police arrived at the McLean apartment at 12:20 a.m., Jesse Brown Hernandez, 22, had died, with a gunshot wound to the upper body, according to a police report.

Alexander Roy, 25, of McLean, was charged with involuntary manslaughter in Hernandez's death and is being held without bond at the Fairfax County Adult Detention Center, police said.

At the time of the shooting, four individuals - including three off-duty Park Police officers - were drinking at the apartment. Alcohol was "believed to be a factor in the shooting," the police report said.

Detectives think Roy was attempting to "dry fire" the gun - that is, pull the trigger of a firearm that is unloaded, police said.
