1 man shot, killed in Northeast, police say

Police are investigating the fatal shooting of a man Saturday night in Northeast Washington, D.C. police said.

Officers were called to the 2100 block of H Street NE at 10:12 p.m., according to D.C. police spokeswoman Hannah Glasgow. Police and emergency medical workers found Kevin McDowell, 34, of Northeast Washington dead at the scene, police said.

Separately, a man who was hospitalized after being shot on Galveston Place SW on Tuesday "succumbed to his injuries on Saturday," police said in a statement Sunday. Alando Pugh, 40, had no fixed address, police said. Police had responded to the shooting about 1:51 a.m.

Police asked the public for information on the circumstances of both killings, noting a reward of up to $25,000 for information that leads to the arrest and conviction of those responsible in each case. They said anonymous information can also be texted to 50411.

Smoke leads to evacuation at Dulles

Passengers were temporarily evacuated from the main terminal at Dulles International Airport on Saturday night after smoke issued from a motorized Segway vehicle used by police there, an airport spokesman said.

A photograph posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, shows the vehicle in flames. It appeared to be a two-wheeled scooter on which an operator stands upright.

The incident occurred about 7:30 p.m., and as a "safety precaution" the spokesman said passengers were evacuated from the departures level. Smoke ventilation was completed by about 9 p.m. and passengers were allowed back in, he said.

"Normal operations have resumed," the spokesman, James Johnson, said in an email. He said about 500 passengers were evacuated.
