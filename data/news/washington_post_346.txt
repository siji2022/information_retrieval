The pregnant woman slain in a double shooting Thursday gave birth to her baby, who, by Friday, was still alive, police said.

The woman, 22-year-old Samya Gill of Fort Washington, Md., was killed about 11:20 a.m. Thursday, after two people with rifles walked over to a parked car where she sat with a man and started shooting. The man was struck but survived.

Gill's family, outside of their home Friday, said they did not want to talk to reporters.

Police have described the attack as targeted and put out a lookout for two suspects and a white car. By Friday, the department said they had no further updates in their investigation.

The shooting occurred in the 300 block of 37th Street SE. The victims then drove to Minnesota Avenue and Dix Street NE, officials said, where police found them suffering from gunshot wounds.

Gill's killing was one of four slayings this week in the nation's capital - a city that has continued to struggle with surging violent crime. Later Thursday, 18-year-old Khalliqo Ford was fatally shot in the 200 block of K Street SW. Maurice Robinson, 24, was killed Tuesday in Southeast. Joseph Crockett, 43, was fatally shot Monday in Southeast.

Homicides, as of Friday, were up 16 percent compared with the same time in 2022. Last year, the city surpassed 200 killings for only the second time in almost two decades.
