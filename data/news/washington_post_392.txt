3 killed in crash on Rock Creek Parkway

Three men were killed early Wednesday on Rock Creek Parkway when the sedan they were in was struck by an SUV fleeing a traffic stop, said Sgt. Thomas Twiname, a spokesman for the U.S. Park Police.

The two occupants of the SUV, a man and a woman, were transported to hospitals with injuries initally thought not to be life-threatening. The woman's injuries were later considered critical, Twiname said.

The incident started just after 1:30 a.m. when a U.S. Park Police officer stopped the SUV for a traffic incident. Police did not say why the vehicle was stopped. The driver "fled" and shortly after collided with the sedan, according to Twiname. He said the officer did not pursue the vehicle that drove off.

As of Wednesday evening, police had not released the identities of those who died.
