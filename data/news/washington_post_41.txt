The Sunday night shooting that killed two men on Capitol Hill began when one or more people in a vehicle opened fire on an SUV, spraying bullets over a nearly half-mile stretch of road and into a sometimes bustling intersection, authorities said Monday.

Releasing new details of the incident, D.C. police spokesman Dustin Sternbeck said that the driver of the SUV had picked up two men in another neighborhood and that another vehicle had apparently followed them.

The shooting started on 11th Street SE, continuing from M Street to Pennsylvania Avenue before ending in the 500 block of 11th Street SE, D.C. police homicide Capt. Kevin Kentish said.

By Monday afternoon, police had not made an arrest.

Police identified one man killed in the incident as Othaniel Gaither, a 34-year-old from Southeast Washington, and said the other slain man, the SUV's driver, would be identified after officers reach his family. Gaither's family could not be immediately reached.

Sternbeck said investigators believe the shooter or shooters might have been targeting at least one person in the SUV.

A third person in the SUV, who was injured when the driver crashed the car amid gunfire and survived, is cooperating with investigators, Kentish said. He said that it was unclear how many people fired shots but that there was no evidence of an exchange of gunfire between the vehicles. He said police had recovered one firearm from the scene.

Homicides are up 25 percent in the city compared with the same period in 2022, which was one of the deadliest years in D.C.'s recent history.

Also Monday, a teenager was shot in the leg just after 2:15 p.m. in the 2200 block of 14th Street NW. Police said they found the victim at a hospital, where he was conscious and breathing.
