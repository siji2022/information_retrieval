Quantico base issues shelter-in-place order

Marine Corps Base Quantico issued a shelter-in-place order Thursday afternoon following a report of shots fired but lifted it after determining that the sound was a car backfiring, a spokesman said.

Capt. Michael Curtis said the initial report of shots fired came in shortly before 1:20 p.m. from an area that includes base housing at Lyman Park.

The base issued the shelter-in-place order and law enforcement began an investigation. All inbound and outbound traffic at the base was halted.

Curtis said law enforcement officials determined that the sound of shots fired was produced by a car backfiring on the base.

Curtis said the base lifted the shelter-in-place order and resumed normal activity about 2:30 p.m.
