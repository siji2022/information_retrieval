D.C. police have identified a 36-year-old man fatally shot Saturday afternoon in the Brightwood neighborhood of Northwest Washington.

Alonzo Jessi Atkins was pronounced dead at the scene of the shooting in the 5500 block of Seventh Street NW, between Kennedy and Longfellow streets, police said in a statement Monday.

The shooting occurred shortly before 1:30 p.m. near Open Streets Georgia Avenue, a day-long event featuring activities and musical performances. Police said there did not appear to be a connection between the event and the shooting.

A police report said that Atkins was found dead in an alley and that two vehicles were struck by gunfire. Authorities said that they knew of no possible motive and that no arrest has been made.

Homicides in D.C. are up 38 percent this year over the same period in 2022.
