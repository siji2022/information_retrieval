D.C. firefighter shot dead while off duty

An off-duty D.C. firefighter was fatally shot early Monday during an altercation outside townhouses in Charles County, Md., according to the local sheriff's office and District officials.

The altercation occurred after the firefighter, 30-year-old Carl Braxton, was accused of assaulting his girlfriend inside their townhouse, police said.

Diane Richardson, a spokeswoman for the Charles County Sheriff's Office, said deputies responded to calls for gunshots about 3:30 a.m. and found the wounded victim near the 2900 block of Sedgemore Place in the Bryans Road area, about 25 miles south of the District. Richardson said he died after being taken to a hospital.

By late Monday, the sheriff's office had not identified or charged the man who authorities said shot Braxton. The agency said that the man remained at the scene until officers arrived, and that there was "no indication any of the involved subjects were known" to him.

In a statement midday Monday, D.C. Fire and EMS Chief John A. Donnelly Sr. said Braxton was an eight-year veteran of the department who served as a firefighter/EMT. He is survived by two sons.

"Our heartfelt condolences to his family, friends and colleagues," Donnelly said in the statement.

Efforts to reach Braxton's family were not successful.

Braxton joined the department as a cadet and graduated in April 2015, according to the fire department statement. He most recently served at Engine Company 22, located in the Shepherd Park neighborhood.

"It's a sad and tragic situation," said David Hoagland, president of the union that represents all active and retired firefighters in the District.
