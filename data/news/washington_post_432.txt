Metro article "Murder suspect who escaped custody at GWU Hospital last month is captured":

The suspect in this case lives in Virginia, is accused of murdering a man from Virginia and was taken into custody in Virginia. After his escape from George Washington University Hospital in the Foggy Bottom area of Northwest D.C., he was found in Maryland.

People, including those who perpetrate violent crimes, transit the area multiple times per day. It is illogical to think the District (which is not a state) alone can prevent the spread of crime from its larger and more populated neighbors: Maryland and Virginia.
