Police: 300 juveniles involved in Wawa fight

A sprawling fight and public disturbance at a Wawa in Northwest Washington prompted police to disperse about 300 juveniles Friday night, police said.

A police report said officers arriving at the Tenleytown convenience store at 40th Street NW on Friday found a "Disorderly Affray," one of the city's offenses covering disturbances of the public peace.

The fight occurred inside and outside the Wawa and started just before 8 p.m., police said. An "affray" is defined as "fighting by mutual consent of two or more people in some public place to the disturbance of others," according to D.C. police training materials.

It was not clear how many people actually came to blows, or why. The police report said that after officers arrived, "the crowd of approximately three hundred juveniles was dispersed from the immediate area."

In a social media post, the D.C. police union reported of "300 juveniles involved in a street brawl inside/outside of Wawa."

The incident was first reported by independent journalist Alan Henney.

D.C. police spokeswoman Hannah Glasgow said there were no reports of injuries or arrests.

A representative of Wawa and the police union did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday.
