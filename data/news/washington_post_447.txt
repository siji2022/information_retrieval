Prosecutors dropped charges against Kevin Cramer Jr., a prominent local activist whom D.C. police arrested during an October climate protest.

Cramer, 27 of Arlington was charged in D.C. Superior Court with three counts of assaulting a police officer and one count of resisting arrest, all of which prosecutors dropped on Monday, court records show.

The case was dismissed without prejudice, Cramer's attorney Brandon Burrell said. This means prosecutors can refile at another time if they choose.

The arrest occurred Oct. 14, during a protest held during the World Bank and International Monetary Fund meetings in D.C. Video showing part of the incident depicts a chaotic scene, with Cramer on the ground surrounded by several police officers. People are heard yelling at police: "Let him go!" and "Get off of his head!" The video does not show what led up to that moment.

Police alleged in an affidavit that Cramer "threw a pile" of leaves and dirt at two officers, striking them in the face. While police attempted to take him into custody, police said, he struck and punched officers.

Cramer, co-founder of the Palm Collective, which is focused on ending systemic racism, said in an interview that he was "brutalized" by police.

An officer, he said, "sat on my head." In the moment, he said, he thought he was going to die.

Cramer said he was injured during the arrest and has shoulder, back and neck pain as a result.

D.C. police did not respond to a request for comment, and a spokesperson for the U.S. attorney's office in the District declined to comment.

"He was protesting, trying to exercise his First Amendment rights, and he didn't have a good experience that day," Burrell said.
