Man dies in custody at Alexandria jail

A 33-year-old man being held at the Alexandria jail died Sunday after collapsing in a housing unit's common room, according to city officials.

Glenn W. Eubanks III, an Alexandria resident who had been in custody since April 12, died "after experiencing an apparent medical emergency" just after 4 p.m. Sunday, Alexandria's sheriff's office said. Eubanks was pronounced dead shortly before 5 p.m. after jail staff and medics administered emergency treatment.

The sheriff's office, which runs the jail, and Alexandria police said they were conducting a death investigation. A spokeswoman for the sheriff's office could not say Monday whether Eubanks had been treated by the jail's medical staff before his death. A police spokesman said a cause of death would be determined by the medical examiner's office.

The Alexandria Public Defender's Office, which represented Eubanks in connection with several misdemeanor charges this year, including larceny and misbehavior in court, said it had not received information about the death from the sheriff's office as of Monday afternoon.
