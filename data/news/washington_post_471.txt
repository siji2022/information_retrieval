Alexandria man charged in shooting

Police have charged a man in connection with the fatal shooting of Nabel Christopher Chavez in Alexandria last week.

Officials released few other details about the case, and court records did not list an attorney for Espinal-Calix as of Wednesday.

Family members for Chavez could not be reached for comment.

Police said they continue to investigate the circumstances of Chavez's death.

Espinal-Calix remains in jail and has a court hearing in Alexandria scheduled for March 31, records show.
