Man slain in Fairfax City is identified

A man who was found dead in Fairfax City last week was identified Friday as Luis Barahona Reyes, and Fairfax City police said they were investigating his death as a homicide. No suspects were in custody Friday evening.

Barahona Reyes, 50, lived in Fairfax City, Sgt. Lisa Gardner said. She said an autopsy Monday determined that he had suffered "severe trauma to the upper body," but she declined to be more specific about the cause of death. No family members of the victim could be immediately located.

Gardner said Barahona Reyes was found by construction workers about 9:20 a.m. June 10 in a trash receptacle in the 9700 block of Fairfax Boulevard, just west of Fairfax Circle, near a store being built there. Police said at the time there was "no reason to believe there is a threat to the community." Gardner said Friday that she could not disclose whether police had a suspect but that "it seems like an isolated incident."
