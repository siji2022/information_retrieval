Two tickets believed to have been used at Ford's Theatre in Washington the night of President Abraham Lincoln's assassination sold at auction Saturday for $262,500.

The price was more than twice the amount expected at the afternoon sale at RR Auction in Boston.

The tickets were for prime front-row seats on the second level - Nos. 41 and 42 D - in the theater's dress circle the night of April 14, 1865. The show featured British actress Laura Keene in the comedy "Our American Cousin."

The original owners of the tickets are unknown. The seller of the tickets Saturday was a manuscript collector from Southern California, who asked to be anonymous, RR Auction said. That person had purchased them at an auction in 2002 for $83,650.

In 1865, dress circle tickets at Ford's cost 75 cents.

Bobby Livingston, executive vice president of RR Auction, would say only that buyer is one of the world's top collectors of Americana.

Also sold with the tickets was the envelope in which they once were enclosed. On the envelope is an old notation in ink: "Front Seats, Dress Circle, Reserved, Complimentary, Fords Theatre, April 14, 1865. (Night of assassination of President Lincoln.)"

Lincoln was murdered at the theater that night by actor John Wilkes Booth, who was later captured and killed. The president died the next morning in a boardinghouse across the street from the theater.

Other Lincoln artifacts also brought top dollar at the auction Saturday.

A rare first edition book signed by Lincoln that contained his 1858 debates with U.S. Sen. Stephen A. Douglas sold for $593,750.

And a Riggs bank check for $5 that Lincoln made out to his African American valet William Johnson went for $100,000.
