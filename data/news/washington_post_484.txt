A man was fatally shot in Southeast Washington on Friday night, and two people were killed in the District on Thursday, raising the number of homicides in the city to seven in the seven days since April 30.

In the Friday killing, the victim was found about 10 p.m. in a dwelling in the 4400 block of B Street SE, police spokeswoman Alaina Gertz said. No name was available.

One of Thursday's slayings occurred in the 3500 block of Hayes Street NE. Marcus Carey, 47, of Southeast, was found in the area a few minutes before midnight. He had been assaulted and died at the scene, police said.

In the other Thursday homicide, Carlos Latney, 18, died in the 5600 block of B Street SE. He had been shot, police said.

The first of the string of killings occurred just before midnight April 30 in the 3800 block of Jay Street NE. Others occurred on M Street NE, Condon Terrace SE and Jamison Street NE.

The overall rate of homicides in the city has increased by about 17 percent over the same time last year and has prompted widespread expressions of concern.
