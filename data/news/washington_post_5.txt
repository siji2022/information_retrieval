Two men were shot, one fatally, in a Northeast Washington park Wednesday, as the District's 2023 homicide toll continues to climb. According to police, the count is approaching 200 fatalities at the earliest point in any year since the late 1990s.

Police said the other victim was conscious when taken to a hospital.

Homicide detectives were continuing to investigate the shootings. By Thursday afternoon, they had not made an arrest.
