Molotov cocktail attack at Cuban Embassy

The U.S. Secret Service is investigating after someone apparently threw at least one molotov cocktail at the Cuban Embassy in Northwest Washington on Sunday night, according to law enforcement authorities and the embassy.

In a statement, the Secret Service, which investigates crimes at foreign missions, said there was no fire and no "significant damage to the building." The D.C. fire department was not called to the scene, a spokesman said.

Molotov cocktails are improvised incendiary devices, typically a container filled with flammable liquid ignited with a burning fuse.

A Secret Service spokesman said no arrest has been made and a motive has not been determined. The incident occurred about 8 p.m. at the embassy in the 2600 block of 16th Street NW, near Meridian Hill Park.

Bruno Eduardo Rodr√≠guez Parrilla, Cuba's minister of foreign affairs, posted on X that two molotov cocktails were thrown at the building. He said no staff members were hurt.
