Baltimore has job fair for squeegee workers

Before squeegee restrictions go into effect Tuesday, the Squeegee Collaborative, created by Baltimore Mayor Brandon M. Scott, held a job fair at the UA House at Fayette in Jonestown.

The collaborative released its action plan in November, part of which outlines six pilot zones where panhandling and solicitations would be documented and penalized.

In July, Timothy Reynolds was killed following a confrontation with squeegee workers at the intersection of Light and Conway streets.

Under the plan, police will issue two warnings and a referral to services. After the first two warnings, violators would be issued a citation.
