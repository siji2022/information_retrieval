Two people arrested at pipeline protest

Two climate advocates were arrested Friday after chaining themselves to the Wilson Building during a protest demanding that D.C. Council members reject a plan to replace pipelines in the city. The two protesters wrapped chains around their waists and through the door handles of the building and linked arms while wearing shirts that read "Stop Project Pipes." The message was referring to Washington Gas's 40-year program, which launched in 2014, to update the city's 1,200-mile natural gas distribution system.

As D.C. police responded to the incident Friday morning, supporters cheered and chanted "D.C.! Gas free!" according to a video from Extinction Rebellion D.C., the climate group that organized the protest. Supporters also held a pink banner that said "GAS LEAKS, METHANE KILLS."

Makhetha Watson, a D.C. police spokesperson, said the protesters were arrested for crowding, obstructing or incommoding, a D.C. code often cited when arresting protesters during peaceful, planned and coordinated actions of civil disobedience such as the demonstration Friday.
