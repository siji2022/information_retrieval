THE DISTRICT

Police car stolen from university grounds

A police car was stolen Friday from a college campus in the city, officials said.

The car, belonging to the police department of the University of the District of Columbia, was taken from campus about 3:45 a.m., the D.C. police said. The campus is in the 4200 block of Connecticut Avenue NW.

The vehicle was found Friday evening, according to Officer Lee Lepe, a D.C. police spokesman. He said it was in what is known as the unit block of P Street NW.

That is just west of North Capitol Street, and about five miles from where the vehicle was taken.

It was not clear who took the car or why or where it had been in the hours between when it was taken and when it was found. The gray 2023 Ford Explorer bore markings clearly indicating it was a police vehicle.

In a city where several categories of crime have increased this year, car theft in particular has sharply risen.

Police statistics show the number of car thefts so far this year to be 6,055, about double the 3,034 reported last year at this time.

Even as car thefts have soared, the police vehicle theft seemed unusual. No information was immediately available about whether any other police vehicles had been stolen in the District this year.
