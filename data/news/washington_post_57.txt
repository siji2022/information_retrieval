Man, 41, charged in Metrorail stabbing

A woman was stabbed and critically wounded Sunday night on a Green Line train at the Navy Yard station in Southeast Washington, a Metro spokesman said. On Monday, a 41-year-old man was charged in the stabbing, and a Metro spokesman said the woman was no longer in critical condition

The station serves Nationals Park, where a game between the Washington Nationals and Miami Marlins finished about 4:30 p.m.

The stabbing was reported shortly before 6 p.m. The approximately 90 minutes between the end of the game and the stabbing would most likely have been enough time for most or all fans using the station to have boarded trains and left.

The entrance to the station at Half Street SE was closed for a time, and trains single-tracked between Navy Yard and Anacostia, Metro said.

On Monday, a Metro Transit Police spokesman said Michael William Harrington, 41, of the District was arrested with the help of Arlington police. Harrington was charged with assault with intent to kill. Metro said the woman's condition had been upgraded to stable.
